A Docker based development environment for doing frontend development with Golang using GopherJS.

# Usage

To use, navigate to the `docker/dev`.

On many systems, you will likely do this with:
```
cd docker/dev
```

Then run the build script.

On many systems, you will likely do this with:
```
sudo ./build.sh
```

(On Linux based systems, docker has to run as root. So `sudo` is needed.
I *think* on Mac the `sudo` part is not needed though.)

After that has come up, it will present you with a message of what to do next.
